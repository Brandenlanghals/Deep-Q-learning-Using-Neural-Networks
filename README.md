# Deep Q-learning Using Neural Networks

In this project, I was provided with a Python notebook containing the initial framework for a treasure hunt game using a deep Q-learning algorithm. The provided code included the game environment, actions, visualization, and the neural network model architecture.

My task involved working on the core functionality within the qtrain function. I designed the Q-learning loop where the pirate agent explores the maze, gathers experiences, trains the neural network model, and evaluates its performance. My focus was on implementing this algorithm to ensure the pirate could efficiently navigate the maze and find the treasure.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists study and create algorithms, software, and technologies to solve diverse problems in areas like artificial intelligence, data analysis, cybersecurity, and software engineering. Their work matters because it drives innovation, empowers industries, and addresses critical challenges. They enable technological advancements, automate tasks, ensure data security, and contribute to scientific discovery. Ultimately, computer scientists shape our digital world, impacting everything from communication and entertainment to healthcare and research.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
First I need to gather requirements and work with stakeholders to figure out what problem we are trying to solve for our end-user. Then I would consider all its actors and the goal of the system. I find it is easier to start at the top with where the actor first exists, then mark down the end goal. After this, dig into what is required and the steps to get there, this is going to fill in the middle. If we correctly go from the user to the end result, we should have mapped out most of the product requirements and should feel confident moving forward with development. Along the way, I find it important to create readable and maintainable code that achieves end-user requirements. Working incrementally at each aspect of the application, I can build on each component to deliver functional results.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, you have a responsibility to create unbiased and transparent solutions that respect user privacy. This project demonstrates how computer scientists use algorithms, models, and software to solve complex problems and shape the future in various fields.
